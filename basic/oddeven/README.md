Odd Even Sample
===============

This example demonstrates the following aspects of the CORE EIP support available with Spring Integration:

1. Inbound Channel Adapter
2. Filter
3. Router (SpEL based)
4. Poller with Cron and Interval Trigers

Messages are simply being emitted by the Poller (interval based or cron) triggering '**next()**' method of Counter class and sent to a '**numbers**' channel - Inbound Channel Adapter. From the '**numbers**' channel Messages are sent to an expression-based router (Spring Expression Language). All that the router does is simply routing messages to *OddLogger* and *EvenLogger* service

To execute the Interval-based sample simply run **IntervalOddEvenDemoTest** class and for Cron-based sample simply 
run CronOddEvenDemo class, You should see the output similar to this:
