Http Sample
===========

This example demonstrates simple request/reply communication when using a pair of **HTTP Inbound/Outbound Gateways**.

It consists of two parts - Client and Server. To run this sample:

1. Deploy project 
   * If you are using STS and project is imported as Eclipse project in your workspace you can just execute **Run on Server**
   * You can also run **mvn clean install** and generate the WAR file that you can deploy the conventional way
2. Run the simple test client program: **org.springframework.integration.samples.http.DemoHttpClient**
   
The gateway initiates a simple request posting "Hello" to the server and server responds by appending **from the other side** to the message payload and returns. You should see the following output from the server:
   
	INFO : org.springframework.integration.samples.http.HttpClientDemo - Replied with: Hello from the other side
